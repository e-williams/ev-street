### ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This is a private project with select contributors, with the purpose of developing a content-based website for electric vehicles that uses stored data to provide the user with a means to display a list of vehicles according to user-selected filter criteria (vehicle specifications).  Each individual listing result, when clicked, will lead to a web page for the selected vehicle that provides additional information such as a photo gallery, and more extensive specifications. Initially, a front-end strategy for storing data (text or JSON file) will be implemented, with the goal of transitioning to a backend database strategy at a later point. Also under consideration is the future implementation of a web content scraper to automatically retrieve and display updated vehicle information and data.
