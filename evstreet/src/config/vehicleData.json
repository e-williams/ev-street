      "paragraph1": "Tesla has significantly more experience designing and producing electric vehicles than any other major auto manufacturer, and it shows in the Model 3. It has a maximum range that is at the top of the competition, and world-class handling and performance characteristics, wrapped in an elegant design. Relatively compact for a luxary sedan, the Model 3 looks sporty but still manages seating for 5 and provides sufficient cargo space.",
      "paragraph2": "From inception, Tesla has been at the forefront of automotive innovation. Engineering achievements like the Model 3's Internal Permanent Magnet Sychronous Reluctance Motor (IPMSynRM) set performance standards that are hard to beat. The Performance trim can rocket from 0 - 60 mph in a blazing 3.1 seconds. The all-glass roof that extends from front to back provides a unique experience and a feeling of openness from any seat. A sleek and minimalist design with refined touches like the carbon fiber spoiler are visually appealing and functional, providing improved aerodynamics and stability. While the interior's central 15 inch touchscreen may look less polished than vehicle designs that incorporate the main screen into the dashboard, it contributes to the interior's angular lines.",
      "paragraph3": "If you are looking for a stylish, luxary EV that seats 5, provides optonal AWD, with nearly unmatched range and superb performance, then you cannot go wrong with the Model 3."

Not only do the Wind RWD and Wind e-AWD trims come standard with a 320 hp powertrain that will propell the EV6 to 60 mph in 5.1 s, but the available GT e-AWD trim achieves a mammoth 576 hp and reaches 60 mph in a stunning 3.4 s.",
      "paragraph2": "With front and rear spoilers, an angular design, and a uniquely styled, thin tail light that spans the full width of the vehicle and aesthetically meets the flare at the base of the side doors, the EV6 is remarquably sporty in appearance, while simultaneously providing a generous 50.2 cu ft of cargo space and room for 5 passengers. Performance innovations, like providing the driver with the ability to select the level of regenerative braking using paddle shifters on the steering wheel, help to make the EV6 stand out. Not only does this feature improve the diving experience, but it also has the potential to help extend driving range. The Wind trim has an EPA estimated range of over 300 mi, which is well over that of many EVs, and all trims will charge from 10% to 80% in a mere 18 minutes with a DC fast charger.",
      "paragraph3": "The Interior of the EV6 is tasteful and nicely styled, with a design that feels continuous and uncluttered. The top of dashboard houses a large, single, digital display that looks more integrated than the approach that some vehicles take of using a separate screen for navigaional information, etc. While the interior may not have as plush a finish as more expensive luxary vehicles, it commendably strives for eco-friendliness, incorporating materials like vegan leather upholstery, natural dyes, and cloth and matting made from recycled plastic.",
      "paragraph4": "As Kia's first dedicated electric vehicle, the EV6 is a superb accomplishment. With impressive performance, relative affordability, ample cargo space, and a wide range of trim options including AWD, the EV6 should definitely be on your list of 5-passenger EVs to consider."

      "paragraph2": "At the heart of every Audi is innovative engineering. The German company is well known for the development of its legenary Quattro all-wheel-drive system, so it's no surprise that the e-tron GT would include an advanced AWD drivetrain, described by Audi as e-torque vectoring plus. Additionally, it's 2-speed transmission is said to provide instantaneous acceleration while also impoving efficiency and range. The optional all-wheel steering not only enhances low-speed maneuverability, such as when parking, but also increases stability at higher speeds, along with the electric rear spoiler. Audi is also only the second auto manufacturer to offer laser headlights, which provide greatly improved visibility over conventional LED lights, and are optional on the vehicle. Superior performance of the e-tron GT can also be found in its charging characteritics, which include an exceptional maximum dc chaging capabiltiy of 270 kW, and an ability to charge from 5% to 80% capacity in only about 23 minutes.",
      "paragraph3": "The interior of the e-tron GT is beautifully styled and provides a comfort level that is typical of the luxary vehicle manufacturer. Some included luxary features are the 14-way power sports seats with optional Nappa leather, a panoramic roof, and the optional LED interior lighting plus package, which gives the user the ability to select from a variety of differnt mood-setting colors. The information/navigational display is nicely incorporated into the dashboard, which both improves aethetics and allows for maximum visibility through the windshield.",
      "paragraph4": "The e-tron GT should be heavily considered by anyone looking for a luxary EV that offers not only extreme AWD performance and industry-leading innovations, but also a level of luxary and styling that is supeior to many alternatives."
